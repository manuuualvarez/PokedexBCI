## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technologies

### MVVM-C Architecture
This application implements the MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) pattern, an evolution of standard MVVM that offers significant advantages:

- **Better Navigation Management**: Coordinators handle all navigation logic, keeping it separate from view controllers
- **Enhanced Testability**: Each component is clearly separated and can be tested in isolation
- **Improved Code Organization**: Clear boundaries between different parts of the application
- **Greater Scalability**: New features can be added with minimal impact on existing code

### Key Technologies
- **UIKit** with programmatic views (no storyboards)
- **SnapKit** for declarative Auto Layout
- **Kingfisher** for efficient image loading and caching
- **SwiftData** for local persistence
- **Swift Package Manager** for dependency management

## üíæ Data Persistence

### SwiftData Implementation
The app leverages SwiftData for efficient local storage of Pok√©mon data:

- **Offline Capabilities**: Search and browse Pok√©mon even without an internet connection
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduces network calls through strategic caching
- **Automatic Updates**: Cache invalidation system to ensure data freshness
- **Type Safety**: Full type safety with Swift's strong type system

## üß™ Testing Strategy

The project prioritizes code quality through comprehensive testing:

- **Unit Tests**: Verify individual components (ViewModels, Services, etc.)
- **Snapshot Tests**: Ensure UI consistency across devices and iOS versions using PointFree's swift-snapshot-testing
- **UI Tests**: Validate user flows and interactions
- **Mock Infrastructure**: Extensive mocking support for testing network calls and data sources

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Pok√©mon Listing & Search
- Browse a comprehensive list of Pok√©mon
- Search functionality to quickly find specific Pok√©mon by name
- Smooth scrolling performance even with large datasets

### Detailed Pok√©mon Information
- Type information with color-coded visual indicators
- Abilities, moves, and base stats
- High-quality sprite images

### Efficient Image Handling
- Optimized image loading pipeline
- Intelligent caching to reduce network usage

## üìö Development Best Practices

- **Clean Code**: Adherence to Swift style guidelines and best practices
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation and comments
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Dependency Injection**: Used throughout the app for better testability
- **Version Control**: Git workflow with meaningful commit messages
